= Building pdf docs

Commands and tools for generating PDF versions of the openCypher documents.

The Asciidoc to PDF tool used is `asciidoctor-pdf`, read more about it link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/convert-asciidoc-to-pdf/[here].

== Style guide

Use the font configuration file `style-guide.yml`, which is mostly a copy of the default configuration file that ships with `asciidoctor-pdf` with the Consolas font added.
Fonts used are loaded from the `fonts` directory (downloaded from link:http://www.fontpalace.com/font-details/Consolas/[fontpalace.com]).
