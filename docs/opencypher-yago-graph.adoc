= The openCypher YAGO graph

The openCypher YAGO graph is a graph based on the link:http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/research/yago-naga/yago/[YAGO dataset], developed by the Max Planck Institute for Informatics.
The graph is intended to serve as a common model for examples sections in Cypher Improvement Proposals and Requests.

The openCypher YAGO graph, or `oc-yago-graph`, is distributed as a standalone openCypher artifact and as a built-in graph in the link:https://github.com/opencypher/openCypher/tree/master/tck[openCypher TCK].
