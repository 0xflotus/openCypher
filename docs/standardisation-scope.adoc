= Standardisation scope of Cypher

One of the challenges faced by this effort to standardise Cypher has been to choose the set of language features to standardise.
Cypher is not a new language, but has several years of history, which includes some historical artifacts left in the feature set.
This is generally not because there hasn't been good replacements, but because Cypher's role has been to support a specific product (Neo4j).
The lifecycle of a standardised language is different, however, and removal of standardised features is generally hard.

With that in mind, the openCypher project is trying to not include language features that are not visioned to be the future of the language.
This document aims to provide a description of the language features elected to become part of the standardised set of features, as well as the features that have been left behind.

It should be noted that openCypher is still a young project, and this division between standardised and non-standardised features will likely be subject to change.
It should also be observed that _additive change_, that is, moving a feature _into_ the standardised set, is generally easier than doing the reverse.
